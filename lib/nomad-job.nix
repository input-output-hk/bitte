However, these replaced allocations will continue to run on the non-responsive client; an operator may desire that these replaced allocations are also stopped in this case — for example, allocations requiring exclusive access to an external resource. When specified, the Nomad client will stop them after this duration. The Nomad client process must be running for this to occur.
